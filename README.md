## üìå Project Overview

This is a full-stack Tourist Booking Platform. The app helps users discover, select, and book tour packages. Users search tours, view guide profiles, and complete secure bookings. The platform handles user auth, bookings, payments hooks, and real-time updates for availability and chat between user and guide. The UI uses React and Tailwind-based components. The backend uses Node, Express, and MongoDB. Firebase handles real-time messaging and auth flows where required.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, React Router, React Hooks, Tailwind CSS, daisyUI, framer-motion
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas)
- Auth & Real-time: Firebase Auth, Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore
- Other: Mongoose, Axios, JWT (for server sessions), Socket fallback via Firebase
- Dev tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, npm / pnpm

---

## Architecture (high level)

- Client (React)
  - Routes: /, /tours, /tours/:id, /guides, /profile, /bookings
  - State: local hooks + context for auth and cart
  - Real-time: Firebase listeners for chat and availability
- API (Express)
  - REST endpoints for tours, guides, bookings, payments
  - Auth middleware verifies JWT from client tokens or Firebase token
  - Webhooks for payment provider
- Data
  - MongoDB stores tours, guides, bookings, users, reviews
  - Firebase stores chat messages and presence data

Diagram (simple)
- Client <-> API <-> MongoDB
- Client <-> Firebase (Auth, Realtime)
- API <-> Payment Provider (webhooks)

## Quick Start ‚Äî Local Development

1. Clone repo
   - git clone https://github.com/IYEDZA/Tourism-Tour-Guide-Booking-Platform.git
   - cd Tourism-Tour-Guide-Booking-Platform

2. Install dependencies
   - Backend: cd server && npm install
   - Frontend: cd client && npm install

3. Environment variables
   - Create .env in server and client.

   Example server .env
   - PORT=5000
   - MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster0.mongodb.net/tourism?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   - JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   - FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
   - FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-client-email
   - FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"

   Example client .env
   - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   - REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   - REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   - REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

4. Seed database
   - The Releases page contains a setup script or packaged seed. Download the release asset (for example tourism-setup.sh) and run it to seed sample data and create test accounts.
   - Example:
     - curl -L -o tourism-setup.sh "https://github.com/IYEDZA/Tourism-Tour-Guide-Booking-Platform/releases/download/v1.0.0/tourism-setup.sh"
     - chmod +x tourism-setup.sh
     - ./tourism-setup.sh

5. Start servers
   - Start backend: cd server && npm run dev
   - Start frontend: cd client && npm start

6. Visit
   - Open http://localhost:3000

## Data Models (summary)

- User
  - _id, name, email, passwordHash, role, avatar, createdAt
- Tour
  - _id, title, description, location, price, duration, tags, images, guideIds

## Authentication & Security

- JWT secures API routes.
- The client can use Firebase Auth for social logins and then exchange Firebase token for a server JWT.
- Server validates user roles for admin routes.
- Passwords store as bcrypt hash.
- Use HTTPS in production and enable CORS origin restrictions.

---

## Real-time & Chat

- Chat uses Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for messages.
- Presence uses Firebase presence APIs to track online guides.
- Booking availability updates push to clients via Firebase listeners.

---

## UI Components & Patterns

- Layout: Header, main, footer. Responsive nav and drawer for mobile.
- Components:
  - TourCard, TourList, TourFilter, GuideCard
  - BookingForm, AvailabilityCalendar
  - ChatPanel, Notifications
  - Admin: TourManager, GuideManager, BookingDashboard
- Styling: Tailwind CSS utility classes, daisyUI for cards, modals, and forms.
- Motion: framer-motion for subtle animations on list changes.

---

## Testing

- Backend: Jest + Supertest for API tests. Mock MongoDB with in-memory server.
- Frontend: React Testing Library for component tests. Snapshot tests for key UI.
- Run tests:
  - server: cd server && npm test
  - client: cd client && npm test

---

## Deployment

- Backend: Containerize with Docker. Push image to registry. Deploy to cloud instances or platforms that support Node.
- Frontend: Build static bundle (npm run build) and host on Vercel, Netlify, or any static host.
- Database: Use MongoDB Atlas with IP whitelist or VPC peering.
- Environment: Store secrets in platform vault or env configs.
- Use CI to run lint, tests, and build then publish to Releases for packaged artifacts.

Docker example (simple)
- docker build -t tourism-api ./server
- docker run -e MONGO_URI="..." -p 5000:5000 tourism-api
